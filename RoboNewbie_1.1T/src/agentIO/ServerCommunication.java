/**
 * Connection to the SimSpark server, receiving and sending of messages via TCP.
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the network protocol of SimSpark. For users of
 * RoboNewbie it is not necessary, to know anything about that protocol.
 * <p>
 * Just use this class as follows: <br>
 * An agent has always exactly one instance of this class. <br>
 * 1) The constructor establishes a connection to the server at the address
 * 127.0.0.1 (localhost). (If the agent should connect to a server with another
 * IP, change the variable "host" of this class.) <br>
 * 2) Pass the instance of this class to the constructors of PercepTorInput and
 * EffectorOutput. <br>
 * 3) Init the robot with method initRobot(...). <br>
 * 4) Avoid using methods getServerMessage() and sendAgentMessage(...), if you
 * donÂ´t know exactly, what you are doing. Use classes PerceptorInput and
 * EffectorOutput!
 * <p>
 * The typical usage of this class together with classes PerceptorInput and
 * EffectorOutput is shown in Agent_BasicStructure in package examples.
 * <p>
 * <p/>
 * Information for developers of RoboNewbie (students actually learning robotics
 * dont need that):
 * <p/>
 * This class realises the sending and receiving of SimSpark messages.
 * <p/>
 * During every cycle of the create agent loop the actual server message has to be
 * read by calling the method getServerMessage(). This synchronizes the agent
 * with the server, and should be done by an object of class PerceptorInput. So
 * the call stack would be:<br>
 * Agent_-class.sense() <br>
 * -> PerceptorInput.update() <br>
 * -> ServerConnection.getServerMessage()
 * <p/>
 * With sendMessage() an agent message can be sent. Also once during the create
 * agent loop, this should be done by class EffectorOutput. Call stack: <br>
 * Agent_-class.act() <br>
 * -> EffectorOutput.sendAgentMessage(); <br>
 * -> ServerConnection.sendAgentMessage();
 * <p/>
 * The source code is partly copied from the RoboCup-Team magmaOffenburg. <br>
 * http://robocup.fh-offenburg.de/html/downloads.htm , downloaded at 14.1.2012.

 * Path in the source directory: <br>

     * (playing to the same side of the field) must have exactly the same team.
